The program aims to dive deep into the VTK library to modify and develop an appropriate GUI for a medical dataset visualizer in DICOM format using VTK and any relevant library. The program includes menu system, able to perform several transformations, save altered model, display, and visualize the loaded model. The program contains a splash screen when starting up, then switch to a minimalist interface with the function of allowing user to choose the dataset from the computer and visualize. The dataset can be slice using mouse wheel to visualize the dataset. The program also requires the ability to modify the dataset as well as saving the modified dataset.
